    "In this journey, I've delved into developing an analysis using data and various data analytics/science techniques, combined with my passion and knowledge of football. The goal is to showcase the top 10 individual performances in FIFA World Cup history by edition, considering key factors that are not always apparent on the field. By forming a mathematical metric that assigns weight to each characteristic, from a global perspective of how I perceive football, a final ranking will be defined to know which players had the best performances in the history of the FIFA World Cup History according to advanced stats."

    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Metric:** We will develop a metric that evaluates different aspects of players' performances in the World Cup, such as goals, assists, key passes, successful dribbles, among others. This metric will allow us to quantify and compare players' performances objectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Establish a Ranking:** Using the created metric, we will establish a ranking of the best individual performances in the World Cup.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Only players who have won the World Cup will be considered.\n",
    "- Statistics evaluated will be those corresponding to the edition in which the player was a champion.\n"
