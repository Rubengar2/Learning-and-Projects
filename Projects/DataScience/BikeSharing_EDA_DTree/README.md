# Bike Sharing Dataset Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to my Bike Sharing Dataset Analysis and Prediction project! This repository contains notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling using the Bike Sharing dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Exploratory Analysis

The [Exploratory Analysis notebook](link_to_notebook) provides an in-depth exploration of the Bike Sharing dataset. It covers insights into bike usage patterns, correlations with weather attributes, and more. 

## Decision Tree Regression

The [Decision Tree Regression notebook](link_to_notebook) showcases regression using Decision Trees on the Bike Sharing dataset. It focuses on modeling a system that predicts bike count based on hourly data and weather attributes.

### Problem Statement

The problem addressed in the Decision Tree Regression notebook is to model a system capable of predicting the bike count using the hourly Bike Sharing dataset, which includes weather and other attributes.

## Dataset Information

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
