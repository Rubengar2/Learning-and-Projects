# Learning-and-Projects
This repository aggregates some of my learning and projects that I have done as part of my open training in the world of data science and AI.

## Practical Machine learning with python - book
Embark on a journey through my personal exploration of machine learning, inspired by the book of the same title. As an avid learner in the field, I've curated a collection of exercises and projects aimed at honing my skills and deepening my understanding of machine learning concepts.

Within this repository, you'll find my hands-on experiments, code snippets, and reflections as I navigate through various machine learning algorithms and techniques. From data preprocessing to model evaluation, each project serves as a testament to my commitment to mastering the art and science of machine learning.
